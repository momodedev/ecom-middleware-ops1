# playbook to deploy the monitoring stack alongside an existing Kafka VMSS
#
# This playbook assumes you have defined two host groups in your Ansible
# inventory:
#
#   - **management_node** – the single control/management node created by
#     Terraform.  Prometheus, Grafana and the Kafka exporter will run on
#     this host.  Deploying the monitoring services on the control
#     node re‑uses existing infrastructure while keeping all Kafka
#     broker ports separate (Prometheus on 9090, Kafka exporter on 9308,
#     and Grafana on 3000).
#
#   - **kafka_broker** – the set of Kafka broker hosts that make up
#     your VM scale set.  Each broker will run a node exporter so
#     Prometheus can collect CPU, memory and disk metrics.
#
# To use this playbook run:
#
#     ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini playbooks/deploy_monitoring_playbook.yml
#
# See the README in this directory for more details.
